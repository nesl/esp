Sensor networks are quickly becoming a flexible, inexpensive, and reliable platform to provide solutions for a
wide variety of applications in real-world settings.  For instance, sensor systems have been used for medical
monitoring, detection and classification for defense purposes, and to perform environmental monitoring.  The increase in the 
proliferation of sensor networks has paralleled by the use of more heterogeneous systems in deployments.  
The ESP Framework aims to
provide a standard method to manage, query, and interact with sensor network systems.  We provide a method to describe sensor systems using ESPml, a XML schema, as the
modeling language.  The fundamental goal of the schema is to be able to describe
sensors in a simple, compact manner while still having the ability to represent essential details about a system such as the general
setup, the type of data that can be provided, and the commands that are available.  In addition, we present a 
web services based framework that provides the basic capabilities for locating, managing, and querying the sensor systems.  A geo-centric web 
interface, based on Google Maps, is created as an end-user interface example for users to interact with the various sensor systems.
