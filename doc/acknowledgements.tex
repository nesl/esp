\section{Acknowledgments}
Thanks goes to Dr. Estrin and Dr. Srivastava for their help throughout the quarter while we progressed on our project.
Their guidance, enquiries, and challenges enabled us improve on the overall system and carefully make design decisions
as the framework was designed.  Furthermore, we appreciate the help of members of the Networked and Embedded System Laboratory
for inspiration on various topics and for entertaining various discussions about the project as a whole.
