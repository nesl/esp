\section{Conclusion}
One of the fundamental characteristics of networks systems, especially sensor networks, is that they are heterogeneous in nature.  With the ESP
framework, we provided a standard method to manage, query, and interact with these varied sensor systems.  ESPml serves
as the model for describing sensor network systems at different levels of granularity.  The ESP architecture, which
includes a registry and system entities, uses
a web service based framework for locating sensor systems and then methods to actually interact with the systems themselves
including getting information and running specific functions.  A geo-centric web interface is provided as a portal for users
to interact with the various sensor systems that are available on the framework as well.
